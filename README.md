# BlockPoll
A secure decentralized polling app, which will allow its users to create and participate in polls over the Ethereum network.


## Introduction 

There are many polling services available to the public, however with each app there is no reassurance that the polls are safe from someone who would want to alter the outcome. For example, there are numerous tools used for submitting multiple times to polling apps because they often only use IP addresses as verification; IP addresses can easily be changed with the use of a VPN 

We propose an app that would function in a similar fashion to these already established polling applications but would have the added layer of security of being built on blockchain. This would mean that polls are safe from spamming, and would be safe in the case of a corrupt polling system

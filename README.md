# BlockPoll
A secure decentralized polling app, which will allow its users to create and participate in polls over the Ethereum network.
## Introduction 
There are many polling services available to the public, however with each app there is no reassurance that the polls are safe from someone who would want to alter the outcome. For example, there are numerous tools used for submitting multiple times to polling apps because they often only use IP addresses as verification; IP addresses can easily be changed with the use of a VPN 
We propose an app that would function in a similar fashion to these already established polling applications but would have the added layer of security of being built on blockchain. This would mean that polls are safe from spamming, and would be safe in the case of a corrupt polling system 
## Features
Users can create new polls (WIP)
2. Users can vote in polls (WIP)
3. Users can search for polls (WIP)
4. Users can see trending and most popular polls (Future Work)
## Getting Started 
The project is not yet deployed as its own website, so in order to use the app you will need to create your own instance.
The project is built with React, so you will need to run the npm commands to get it started. You will also need an instance of Ganache running, and will need to edit the relevant info in config.js
